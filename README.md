# leaflet-challenge

As with my previous challenges, whenever I run into an area in the code where I feel stuck I show it to chatGPT and ask for suggestions. Areas where I've directly pulled from chatGPT are noted with a // comment on the logic.js file. I was also having issues with creating my legend and ended up modifying the css file per chatGPT's suggestion. This has also been noted with a comment.
